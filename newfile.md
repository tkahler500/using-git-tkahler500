# The document saying I learned something

## So what did I learn?

I learned there was such thing as profile READMEs. Somehow I'd been browsing GitHub profiles for some time looking at projects by Linux enthusiasts and I had neglected this. I don't know how much people use them; maybe I just need to scroll down further, past the activity map.

## What am I confused about?

I wonder a bit about how merges work exactly, especially given that code updates are done all the time, perhaps on the same files. That would probably have to delve into the inner workings and source code of Git itself, so if that's outside the scope of this course I don't mind. It's just a little something.
